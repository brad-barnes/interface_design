            Hi! My name is Brad Barnes. I've been a guitar player for years and
            a guitar teacher for years.
          </p>
          <p>

            folk and acoustic to blues to jazz to basic country.
          </p>
          <h3>You Need to Match with the RIGHT Teacher</h3>

            I'll always be honest with you and do my best to steer you in the
            right direction, so if you're looking for advanced classical guitar
            for instance, I'll do my best to recommend a fantastic teacher for
            you but that's just not my specialty. The same for goes for advanced
            country lead guitar and advanced jazz guitar as well.

          <h3 class="mobile-responsive">Types of Lessons</h3>
          <p>ALL guitar lessons are in-studio or via Skype/Zoom.</p>
          <p>
            So if you can't come to me the only other option is to do online
            lessons.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>In Person One on One Lessons</li>
            <li>In Person Small Group Lessons (3 student max)</li>
            <li>Online One on One Lessons</li>
            <li>Online Group Lessons (2 student max)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>In Person One on One Lessons</h3>
          <p>
            In person and one on one is definitely the preferred learning
            situation. You will have your lesson free of the distractions of
            technology and things that may be going on around you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a beginner or you are working on unfamiliar techniques, I
            am able to reach over and help manuever your hands to help you
            adjust your technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is obviously impossible online, and it's usefulness is hard to
            overstate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest advantage, though, is that we can play together in
            person. Online there is always a slight delay from when you speak to
            when I hear and vice versa.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that we can't play together at the same time which is
            extremely important, especially for beginners.
          </p>
          <h3>In Person Group Lessons</h3>
          <p>
            In person group lessons have the same advantages and disadvantages
            as individual in person lessons, but it can be more difficult to
            progress as quickly since we often have to move at the pace of the
            slowest student.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the upside, if there are multiple dedicated students in a group,
            you all can learn to jam together which is fantastic!
          </p>
          <h3>Online One on One Lessons</h3>
          <p>
            These are by far the most convenient lessons to have.You don't have
            to fight traffic to get here on time. You don't even have to be in
            the same city or country!
          </p>
          <p>
            You do, however, need really reliable and reasonably fast internet
            access.
          </p>
          <p>
            The downside is that we can't play along with each other, which is
            extremely valuable in the learning experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I can't reach over and adjust your hands as your learning new
            techniques, although I have a LOT of experience teaching most of the
            things I'm asked to teach so that we can often find other solutions
            to help the learning experience for you.
          </p>
          <h3>Online Group Lessons</h3>
          <p>
            All the same from above applies, but bear in mind that it's even
            harder to keep everyone together when we're online so I limit group
            lessons online to 2 people to protect the quality of your learning
            experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Specifics About Your Guitar Goals</h3>
          <p>I want to craft a unique plan to help you achieve your goals.</p>
          <p>
            We'll want to discuss your goals, background, current experience (if
            any), etc. with one another before we move forward.
          </p>

            me a message and we can get that conversation started!
          </p>

            Hi, guitar folks! Welcome to the world of Brad Barnes, passionate
            guitar instructor.
          </p>
          <p class="about-age">
            From his earliest days as a beginning guitarist years ago, Brad knew
            he wanted to be a teacher. There is just nothing like listening to
            someone's guitar dreams and helping them get there step by step.
            Some people get all excited about the idea of playing guitar but get
            sidelined by the sometimes confusing and overwhelming process of how
            to actually develop the skill that they are so excited about.
          </p>
          <p class="transform-text-2">Not Brad!</p>
          <p class="about-age2">
            Brad is one of those rare people that LOVES breaking down the
            process to bite-sized pieces and walking students through each step
            until can truly perform each new skill. He can't make you practice,
            but if you're like so many students of his over the last years,
            you'll WANT TO PRACTICE!
          </p>
          <p>
            Brad got started with guitar at the age of 15 after a bit of
            experience with choir and then playing bass in school orchestra.
            After just a year he was studying guitar at a local community
            college and after two years he won his first scholarship. He quickly
            became known for his passionate and virtuosic approach to guitar.
          </p>
          <p>
            He transferred to the prestigious University of North Texas as a
            music composition major at the advice of one of his music theory
            instructors after he was the only student at his college to pass the
            UNT Theory Proficiency Exam a semester early.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brad went on to start his Masters in Music Education but did not
            complete this as he was very busy with a full student load in his
            private studio.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1997, Brad began teaching full time out of his home in Dallas,
            Texas. After years of accumulating all kinds of tools and approaches
            for learning guitar, he started combining these teaching ideas
            together into a very successful approach that was taking students
            from literally no experience to strumming through songs while
            tapping their foot and keeping the form of the song so that people
            could sing along with them without getting lost. Many of them went
            on to perform publicly impressing their peers and parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            From his earliest days as a music student, whether it's with guitar
            or music theory or anything else, Brad never considered anything
            learned unless he could successfully teach what he was learning to
            someone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brad has developed a reputation as an amazing performer. He has
            played rock, jazz, funk, blues and many other styles from the
            Caribbean to Los Angeles. This performing experience allows him to
            help his students incorporate good performance habits into their
            practice which allows them to perform as well if they should feel so
            inclined, though there's never pressure to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            From absolute beginners all the way to experienced, gigging
            performers, Brad can help you achieve your guitar goals.
