          <h3>Welcome Aboard!</h3>
          <p class="home-ages">
            Hi! My name is Brad Barnes. I've been a guitar player in the
            <span class="bold">Plano, Texas</span> area for years and a guitar
            teacher for years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I teach a lot of styles of guitar ranging from rock and metal to
            folk and acoustic to blues to jazz to basic country.
          </p>
          <h3>You Need to Match with the RIGHT Teacher</h3>
          <p>
            I'll always be honest with you and do my best to steer you in the
            right direction, so if you're looking for advanced classical guitar
            for instance, I'll do my best to recommend a fantastic teacher for
            you but that's just not my specialty. The same for goes for advanced
            country lead guitar and advanced jazz guitar as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the huge number of you that want to learn rock, folk, metal,
            blues, jazz, music theory, music composition, improvisation, guitar
            technique, shred guitar, and many other styles and
            specializations...

          <h3>(PLANO, TEXAS) In Person One on One Lessons</h3>
          <p>
            In person and one on one is definitely the preferred learning
            situation. You will have your lesson free of the distractions of
            technology and things that may be going on around you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a beginner or you are working on unfamiliar techniques, I
            am able to reach over and help manuever your hands to help you
            adjust your technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is obviously impossible online, and it's usefulness is hard to
            overstate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest advantage, though, is that we can play together in
            person. Online there is always a slight delay from when you speak to
            when I hear and vice versa.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that we can't play together at the same time which is
            extremely important, especially for beginners.
          </p>
          <h3>(PLANO, TEXAS) In Person Group Lessons</h3>
          <p>
            In person group lessons have the same advantages and disadvantages
            as individual in person lessons, but it can be more difficult to
            progress as quickly since we often have to move at the pace of the
            slowest student.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the upside, if there are multiple dedicated students in a group,
            you all can learn to jam together which is fantastic!
          </p>
          <h3>Online One on One Lessons</h3>
          <p>
            These are by far the most convenient lessons to have.You don't have
            to fight traffic to get here on time. You don't even have to be in
            the same city or country!
          </p>
          <p>
            You do, however, need really reliable and reasonably fast internet
            access.
          </p>
          <p>
            The downside is that we can't play along with each other, which is
            extremely valuable in the learning experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I can't reach over and adjust your hands as your learning new
            techniques, although I have a LOT of experience teaching most of the
            things I'm asked to teach so that we can often find other solutions
            to help the learning experience for you.
          </p>
          <h3>Online Group Lessons</h3>
          <p>
            All the same from above applies, but bear in mind that it's even
            harder to keep everyone together when we're online so I limit group
            lessons online to 2 people to protect the quality of your learning
            experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Specifics About Your Guitar Goals</h3>
          <p>I want to craft a unique plan to help you achieve your goals.</p>
          <p>
            We'll want to discuss your goals, background, current experience (if
            any), etc. with one another before we move forward.

            Hi, guitar folks! Welcome to the world of Brad Barnes, passionate
            guitar instructor.
          </p>
          <p class="about-age">
            From his earliest days as a beginning guitarist years ago, Brad knew
            he wanted to be a teacher. There is just nothing like listening to
            someone's guitar dreams and helping them get there step by step.
            Some people get all excited about the idea of playing guitar but get
            sidelined by the sometimes confusing and overwhelming process of how
            to actually develop the skill that they are so excited about.
          </p>
          <p class="transform-text-2">Not Brad!</p>
          <p class="about-age2">
            Brad is one of those rare people that LOVES breaking down the
            process to bite-sized pieces and walking students through each step
            until can truly perform each new skill. He can't make you practice,
            but if you're like so many students of his over the last years,
            you'll WANT TO PRACTICE!
          </p>
          <p>
            Brad got started with guitar at the age of 15 after a bit of
            experience with choir and then playing bass in school orchestra.
            After just a year he was studying guitar at a local community
            college and after two years he won his first scholarship. He quickly
            became known for his passionate and virtuosic approach to guitar.
          </p>
          <p>
            He transferred to the prestigious University of North Texas as a
            music composition major at the advice of one of his music theory
            instructors after he was the only student at his college to pass the
            UNT Theory Proficiency Exam a semester early.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brad went on to start his Masters in Music Education but did not
            complete this as he was very busy with a full student load in his
            private studio.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1997, Brad began teaching full time out of his home in Dallas,
            Texas. After years of accumulating all kinds of tools and approaches
            for learning guitar, he started combining these teaching ideas
            together into a very successful approach that was taking students
            from literally no experience to strumming through songs while
            tapping their foot and keeping the form of the song so that people
            could sing along with them without getting lost. Many of them went
            on to perform publicly impressing their peers and parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            From his earliest days as a music student, whether it's with guitar
            or music theory or anything else, Brad never considered anything
            learned unless he could successfully teach what he was learning to
            someone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brad has developed a reputation as an amazing performer. He has
            played rock, jazz, funk, blues and many other styles from the
            Caribbean to Los Angeles. This performing experience allows him to
            help his students incorporate good performance habits into their
            practice which allows them to perform as well if they should feel so
            inclined, though there's never pressure to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            From absolute beginners all the way to experienced, gigging
            performers, Brad can help you achieve your guitar goals.

          <h3>A few words from Brad's former students...</h3>
          <blockquote>
            “I DON’T BELIEVE I WAS EVER SUPPOSED TO PLAY GUITAR. My fingers are
            short and stubby, and they don’t move particularly fast. However,
            Brad Barnes was able to teach me the true value of hard work when it
            comes to playing this wonderful instrument. Brad showed me what it
            takes to OVERCOME THE MENTAL BLOCK in improving your playing. His
            sheer dedication to his own scale work during his warm-ups should
            have been convincing enough, but I believe I was a little more
            stubborn than the rest. I needed a little more persuasion to believe
            that I wanted to put in the necessary work to legitimately play the
            guitar.
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            Brad BUILT UP MY CONFIDENCE AND MY SKILL SET each week for five
            years. I wasn’t interested in learning other people’s songs; I had
            always wanted my own songs to write, record, and perform. He made it
            so easy for me to learn the CAGED system as well as modes. After
            each lesson I would go home and write a new song based on what I had
            just learned. With Brad’s patience and amazing teaching ability, I
            AM NOW A COMPLETE GUITARIST and feel I can effectively communicate
            my ideas both verbally and with my playing. I AM NOW A BELIEVER.
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            I attribute all the success I’ve had in music to Brad. In high
            school, my band won a battle of the bands competition put on by NAMM
            and our prize was to play a show at Musik Messe in Frankfurt,
            Germany. Since high school, I’ve been playing in a band called Gum
            and Ketchup. We recently finished our first album Friends of
            Friends, and Brad’s lessons are densely packed within each song.
            When I listen to my songs it takes me right back to the lessons
            where I had honed these techniques. I am forever grateful, and I
            encourage anyone who reads this to BELIEVE IN BRAD.”

            “Oh Brad Barnes ! About a year ago I decided to take some guitar
            lessons to clean up my playing. I asked around for a few suggestions
            on who I should go to and they all said, “Go to Brad Barnes”. After
            my first lesson with him it was clear to me why HE’S THE ONLY NAME I
            HEARD ANYONE SAY. He understands guitar playing from the inside out,
            the under, the over and the in between. When it comes to the mental
            aspect of playing, practicing and performing, he is also a master. A
            good teacher not only needs to have the knowledge and understanding
            of what they are teaching, but also the ability to deliver that
            knowledge to their student. BRAD IS A NATURAL TEACHER. When I play
            and perform these days I am constantly using things I learned from
            him. Whether it’s to relax my hand, remember to breathe or to add
            accents to the chords, I’M HEARING HIS WORDS AS I PLAY. He is a
            badass in every way, talented and warm-hearted, and I RECOMMEND
            LEARNING GUITAR FROM HIM ABOVE ANYONE ELSE!”

            “I was looking for guitar lessons in the spring of 2000, and Brad’s
            website was the one that came up first in the Google search for
            “Dallas guitar lessons.” Most would immediately assume upon seeing
            his site that Brad was a pro, and that he knew what he was talking
            about – and they’d be right. I took private lessons with Brad for
            years and since doing so, the guitar has become an integral part of
            my life and career as a professional musician. Brad was able to
            break down guitar concepts in a way immediately applicable to me,
            and instantly useful in any musical situation. Even though I had a
            classical background playing brass instruments and piano, the guitar
            quickly became the central instrument in my career. I’ve since won 2
            Emmy awards, scored films, played in countless sessions, done
            hundreds of shows a year, and am currently a full time record
            producer/songwriter – all built on the foundation of being able to
            pick up a guitar, and play. Brad’s innovative methods directly
            contributed to the successes I have had in my career as a musician,
            which is why I always recommend him to anyone who needs lessons or
            wants to improve their skills at guitar. I never known anyone more
            passionate about teaching the guitar, period. Brad is the absolute
            best!!”

            THE BEST THINGS I’VE EVER DONE. Not only did I befriend a fantastic
            person, but I learned a lot about the guitar, as well. I’ve wanted
            to play acoustic guitar since I was little. I was looking for a good
            instructor and was referred by a mutual friend and former student of
            Brad’s. I was definitely a beginner, but Brad never made me feel
            that way. He was very encouraging and that helped to keep me
            motivated. I ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TO MY LESSONS. He’s an amazing
            guitarist and seeing him perform live is always a phenomenal show.
            He’s an excellent instructor for any level of guitar playing, and I
            highly recommend him. Brad is one of the best people I know, and his
            love of music is very apparent on both a performance and

          <blockquote>
            “When I started guitar lessons, my main goal was to learn music
            theory and to improve my playing because I HAD BEEN STUCK IN A RUT
            FOR YEARS. At my first lesson, I had no clue how to tell what the
            key signature was, how to build chords, what a “real” major scale
            was (not a major pentatonic scale), arpeggios, and I can go on and
            on. We started slow and just constantly built on what I had learned
            the prior week. Now, I can look at a key signature and immediately
            know what key it’s in. I can play all of my major scales, minor
            scales, and know all the different modes, Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian,
            etc. I can also play different arpeggios, major, minor, minor 7, and
            so on, which I can use to play over chords as well as use during
            solos, especially in jazz. But one of the things I am most grateful
            about learning, is how to build chords. This is not only good to
            know for playing the guitar, but it can also use it with any
            instrument. I found myself sitting at a piano this last week trying
            to play a song and could immediately play it because I knew the
            chords and what notes made up those chords. IT WAS A GREAT FEELING
            TO BE ABLE TO TAKE WHAT I LEARNED ON ONE INSTRUMENT AND APPLY IT TO
            ANOTHER.

          <blockquote>
            I would recommend Brad Barnes as a music teacher. He’s funny, goofy,
            and RELATES WHAT YOU’RE LEARNING TO SOMETHING YOU CAN IDENTIFY WITH
            to make it easier to learn and remember. But most of all, the guy is
            smart. He really knows his music theory, and everything dealing with
            it, backwards, forwards, and every direction in-between.”
